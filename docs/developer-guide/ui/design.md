**We strive for a user interface that is clutter-free, well-organized, and doesn't behave in unexpected ways. It should work across a wide range of devices and be easy to use for everyone.**

## Theme Colors

Theme definitions live in [`frontend/src/options/themes.js`](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/frontend/src/options/themes.js), with the actual palette tokens mapped to Vuetify in [`frontend/src/css/themes.css`](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/frontend/src/css/themes.css) and [`frontend/src/css/root.css`](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/frontend/src/css/root.css). When you change default colors, update both the JSON structure (so new installs pick it up) and the CSS variables (so runtime theme switches keep working). Avoid editing Vuetify’s compiled CSS directly — always override via our [`vuetify.css`](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/frontend/src/css/vuetify.css) layer.

The colors we use should be consistent and functional, for example, provide sufficient contrast. For the included themes, the preferred primary colors are violet and cyan, but other colors can be used as well.

*To avoid distorting the visual impression of photos and videos, large background areas should generally be neutral or just slightly saturated.*

## Context Menu

The context menu at the bottom right should use a color spectrum for the individual actions to reflect the spectral colors of a prism:

## Icon Fonts

Vuetify is configured to use Material Design Icons (MDI) through [`frontend/src/app.js`](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/frontend/src/app.js) and [`frontend/src/options/themes.js`](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/frontend/src/options/themes.js). Stick to Google’s Material icon set unless a feature requires a bespoke pictogram; mixing icon packs makes the UI look inconsistent and adds extra font downloads.
