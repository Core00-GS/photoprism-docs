# Computer Vision Commands

## Save Model Configuration 

To write the model configuration to a `vision.yml` file you can run:

```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism vision save
```

You can then configure the `vision.yml` file according to your specific needs.

## View Model Configuration

You can use the following terminal command, to inspect your current model configuration:

```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism vision ls
```
### Command Options

You can combine it with these flags to change the output format:

| Command Flag | Description                            |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| `--md, -m`   | format as machine-readable Markdown    |
| `--csv, -c`  | export as semicolon separated values   |
| `--tsv, -t`  | export as tab separated values         |

## Run Vision Models

Once you have configured your preferred computer vision models and services in the `vision.yml` file, you can use the following command to run a model on a set of pictures, as specified by the search filter:

```bash
photoprism vision run [options] [filter]
```

### Command Options

| Command Flag                  | Description                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--models MODELS`, `-m MODELS`| computer vision MODELS to run, e.g. caption, labels, or nsfw (default: "caption")                                               |
| `--count NUMBER`, `-n NUMBER` | maximum NUMBER of pictures to be processed (default: 100000)                                                                    | 
| `--source TYPE`, `-s TYPE`    | custom data source TYPE (auto, default, image, marker, ollama, openai, vision) (default: "image")                              |
| `--force`, `-f`               | force existing data to be updated if the model supports it and the source priority is equal to or higher (default: false)      |

To generate captions for all photos in your library, you can run:

```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism vision run --models=caption
```

Note: Processing time will vary based on your library size and hardware performance and may take a considerable amount of time for large collections.

If you have a model for labels configured in your `vision.yml` you can run the following to generate labels:

```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism vision run --models=labels
```

To generate captions only for photos matching a specific search filter such as those in a particular album, use the following command:
```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism vision run --models=caption album:Holidays
```

To re-generate captions for photos that already have some, add the --force flag to your command:

```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism vision run --models=caption --force
```

This is especially useful when testing different models or prompts. Note that the configured source must have a equal or higher priority than the source of the existing captions for them to be replaced.

## Reset Vision Data

The `photoprism vision reset` command allows you to reset data generated by computer vision models for pictures that match the specified search filters. This is useful when you want to clear existing AI-generated data and start fresh, or when switching between different models.

```bash
photoprism vision reset [options] [filter]
```

### Command Options

| Command Flag                   | Description                                                                                       |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--models MODELS`, `-m MODELS` | computer vision MODELS to reset, e.g. caption or labels                                           |
| `--count NUMBER`, `-n NUMBER`  | maximum NUMBER of pictures to be processed (default: 100000)                                      |
| `--source TYPE`, `-s TYPE`     | custom data source TYPE (auto, default, image, marker, ollama, openai, vision) (default: "image") |
| `--yes`, `-y`                  | runs the command non-interactively (default: false)                                               |

!!! warning ""
    You must always specify the `--source` flag to reset data from a specific source. Without it, the command may not reset any pictures. Use the source that matches where your data came from (e.g., `ollama` or `image`).

### Examples

To reset captions generated by Ollama for all photos in your library:

```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism vision reset --models=caption --source=ollama --yes
```

To reset labels for photos in a specific album:

```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism vision reset --models=labels --source=ollama album:TestAlbum
```

!!! note ""
    The `--yes` flag runs the command non-interactively without requiring confirmation. Omit this flag if you want to be prompted before the reset operation begins.

!!! note "Regenerating captions deleted in the UI"
    If you cleared captions in the Web UI, either individually or via batch edit, the caption source becomes `manual` or `batch`. In this case, `photoprism vision reset` cannot fully clear the processing markers, and `vision run` with the default source may skip those photos.

    To regenerate captions for these pictures, run the caption model with an explicit `vision` source instead of using `vision reset`:

    ```bash
    docker compose exec photoprism photoprism vision run --models=caption --source=vision
    ```

    The `vision` source has a high priority (64), which allows it to replace `manual` and `batch` caption sources when the model supports overwriting existing data (for example when used together with `--force`). You can inspect all available sources and their priorities with:

    ```bash
    photoprism vision sources show
    ```

    Relevant caption-related sources currently have these default priorities:

    - `image`: 8 (built-in TensorFlow models)
    - `ollama`: 16 (Ollama captions and labels)
    - `openai`: 16 (OpenAI captions and labels)
    - `batch`: 64 (batch edit in the UI)
    - `vision`: 64 (manual vision runs via CLI)
    - `manual`: 64 (captions edited directly in the UI)

## Face Detection Commands

PhotoPrism provides specialized commands for managing face detection, clustering, and optimization. These commands are particularly useful when switching between detection engines or troubleshooting face recognition issues.

### Index Faces

Detect faces in your photos:

```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism faces index [subfolder]
```

### Audit Face Data

Check the integrity of face embeddings and cluster statistics:

```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism faces audit
```

To automatically fix normalization issues and update face distances:

```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism faces audit --fix
```

To audit a specific person:

```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism faces audit --subject=<person-uid>
```

This provides detailed information including:

- Retry counts for cluster merging
- Sample statistics
- Outstanding clusters that need attention

### Optimize Face Clusters

Run the clustering optimization algorithm to merge similar face clusters:

```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism faces optimize
```

If you've manually cleaned up problematic clusters and want to retry merging:

```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism faces optimize --retry
```

This clears retry counters and allows the optimizer to reprocess clusters that previously failed to merge.

### Reset Face Detection

Clear all face data and start fresh:

```bash
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism faces reset
```

!!! danger ""
    The `faces reset` command will delete all existing face markers and clusters. Make sure you have backups if needed, as this operation cannot be undone.
