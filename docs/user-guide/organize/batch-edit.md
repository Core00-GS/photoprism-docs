# Batch Edit

With batch editing, you can change the metadata, albums, and labels of multiple pictures at once. If this feature is enabled, you can select up to 999 photos and apply the same changes to either the entire selection or a subset of it.

## Batch Dialog

To open the batch dialog:

1. Select multiple pictures
2. Open the context menu
3. Click :material-pencil:

The dialog displays the current values if they are the same for the entire selection. If values differ, you will see `<mixed>`.

!!! note ""
    You can deselect pictures in the dialog to exclude them from the changes. Note, however, that this will **not update** the displayed values dynamically.

## Editing Labels and Albums

Labels and Albums that are assigned to all selected photos are listed first. To remove them, click on the label or album chip.

You can add labels and albums that are assigned to some, but not all, of the selected photos to all by clicking on the label or album chip once. To remove it from all, click twice.
Additional labels or albums can be added or created using the input field.
