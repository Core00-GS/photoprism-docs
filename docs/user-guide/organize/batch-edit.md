# Batch Edit

Batch editing lets you change metadata for many items at once. When enabled in Settings, you can select up to 999 photos and apply the same changes in a single step.

## Batch Dialog

To open the batch dialog:

1. Select multiple pictures
2. Open the context menu
3. Click :material-pencil:

The dialog shows the current value if **all selected items** share the same value. If values differ, the field displays `<mixed>`.
Please note that you can deselect items in the dialog, but the field previews are **not updated** dynamically.

## Editing Labels and Albums

Labels and Albums that are assigned to all selected photos are listed first. To remove them, click on the label or album chip.

You can add labels and albums that are assigned to some, but not all, of the selected photos to all by clicking on the label or album chip once. To remove it from all, click twice.
Additional labels or albums can be added or created using the input field.
