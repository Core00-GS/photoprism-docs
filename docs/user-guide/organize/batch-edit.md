# Batch Edit

With batch editing, you can change the metadata, albums, and labels of many pictures at once. If this feature is enabled, you can select up to **999** pictures and apply the same changes to either the entire selection or a subset of it.

## Opening the Dialog

To open the **Batch Edit** dialog:

1. Select multiple pictures.
2. Open the context menu.
3. Click the pencil :material-pencil: icon.

The form fields in the dialog show the current values only if they are the same for the entire selection. If the values differ, you will see `<mixed>`. Entering a new value replaces the existing values on **all** pictures you apply the change to.

!!! note ""
    You can deselect pictures in the dialog to exclude them from the changes. The values shown in the fields still reflect the **original selection**, even if you deselect some pictures.

## Labels and Albums

Entries that are assigned to **all** selected pictures are listed first. Each entry is shown as a small chip. If a [label](labels.md) or [album](albums.md) is assigned to only some of the selected pictures, its chip is shown as *partially assigned*.

- Click a partially assigned label or album chip **once** to assign it to **all** selected pictures.
- Click the same chip **again** to remove that label or album from **all** selected pictures.

You can assign additional labels or albums using the input field:

- Start typing to search existing labels and albums.
- If the name does not exist yet, a new label or album will be created automatically.
