# Batch Edit

With batch editing, you can change the metadata, albums, and labels of multiple pictures at once. If this feature is enabled, you can select up to 999 photos and apply the same changes to either the entire selection or a subset of it.

## Batch Dialog

To open the batch dialog:

1. Select multiple pictures
2. Open the context menu
3. Click :material-pencil:

The dialog displays the current values if they are the same for the entire selection. If values differ, you will see `<mixed>`.

!!! note ""
    You can deselect pictures in the dialog to exclude them from the changes. Note, however, that this will **not update** the displayed values dynamically.

## Editing Labels and Albums

Any labels and albums assigned to the entire selection are listed first. To remove a label or album, click on its chip.

To add a label or album assigned to some, but not all, of the selected photos to all, click the label or album chip once. Click twice to remove it from all. You can add or create additional labels or albums using the input field.
