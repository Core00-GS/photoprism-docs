!!! info "Keeping iOS Originals"
    iOS may convert photos and videos to a more compatible format **before** they are uploaded via Safari or the PhotoPrism PWA, so PhotoPrism will receive and store the already converted files.

    To keep your originals:

    - In the iOS Photos picker, tap the three-dot menu (…) → *Options* → set **Format** to **Current** instead of **Automatic** so your original files are kept.
    - Alternatively, use dedicated sync apps like [PhotoSync](../sync/mobile-devices.md#using-photosync), which can upload files in their original format via WebDAV.
