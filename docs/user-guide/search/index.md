# Browsing and Searching Your Library

With its many views and search filters, PhotoPrism allows you to explore your photo collection in multiple ways instead of just scrolling through it day by day.

These features help you rediscover long-forgotten shots, find specific pictures, and quickly create albums based on search results.

## Views and Filters

Using the main navigation you can visit the different sections of your photo library:

### :material-magnify: Search

This section shows all photos and videos that are not in review, archived, or private.

!!! hint ""
    In case the review, private or archive functions are turned off - Search displays those photos and videos as well.
