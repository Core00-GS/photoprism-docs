# Face Recognition

PhotoPrism uses the following multi-stage AI pipeline that detects faces, generates embeddings, and clusters similar faces so they can be [easily organized by person](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/organize/people/):

1. **Detection** - The Pigo or ONNX SCRFD engines are used to detect faces in images.
2. **Embedding** - 512-dimensional vectors are generated to characterize each face.
3. **Clustering** - Similar faces are grouped, so they can be assigned to a person.

## Detection Engines

You can choose between two face detection engines, each with different characteristics:

### Pigo

[Pigo](https://github.com/esimov/pigo) is a fast, CPU-only cascade classifier based on [pixel intensity comparisons](https://dl.photoprism.app/pdf/publications/20140820-Pixel_Intensity_Comparisons.pdf). It provides good performance for straightforward face detection scenarios and maintains PhotoPrism's historical detection behavior.

**Best for:**

- Quick processing of well-lit, front-facing portraits
- Lower resource consumption on small devices

### ONNX SCRFD 0.5g

ONNX Runtime-backed CNN model that delivers **higher recall** on challenging faces. This engine:

- Detects faces that are partially occluded (covered by hands, objects, etc.)
- Works better with off-axis or angled faces
- Handles difficult lighting conditions more effectively
- Consumes 720px thumbnails (model input 640px)
- Schedules work on the meta/vision workers
- Defaults to half the available CPUs (minimum 1 thread)

The ONNX engine is automatically enabled when `FACE_ENGINE=auto` and the bundled SCRFD model is present. The prebuilt runtime targets glibc ≥ 2.27 on x86_64/arm64 architectures.

**Best for:**

- Maximum face detection accuracy
- Photos with challenging angles or lighting
- Group photos with partially obscured faces

## Configuration

    We recommend that only advanced users and developers change these parameters.

### Detection Settings

| Environment Variable           | CLI Flag              | Default                 | Description                                                                |

| PHOTOPRISM_FACE_ENGINE         | --face-engine         | auto                    | Detection engine (`auto`, `pigo`, `onnx`). `auto` uses ONNX when available |
| PHOTOPRISM_FACE_ENGINE_THREADS | --face-engine-threads | runtime.NumCPU()/2 (≥1) | Number of ONNX inference threads; ignored by Pigo                          |
| PHOTOPRISM_FACE_ANGLE          | --face-angle          | -0.3,0,0.3              | Detection angles in radians for Pigo multi-angle scanning                  |

### Clustering Settings

!!! danger ""
    It is strongly recommended that you run the "photoprism faces reset" command in a terminal to remove existing clusters and mappings after changing any of the clustering parameters, as otherwise inconsistencies may result in unexpected behavior or errors.

| Environment Variable           | CLI Flag               | Default  | Description                                                                            |
|--------------------------------|------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PHOTOPRISM_FACE_CLUSTER_SIZE   | --face-cluster-size    | 80       | Minimum size of automatically clustered faces in `PIXELS` (20-10000)                   |
| PHOTOPRISM_FACE_CLUSTER_SCORE  | --face-cluster-score   | 15       | Minimum `QUALITY` score of automatically clustered faces (1-100)                       |
| PHOTOPRISM_FACE_CLUSTER_CORE   | --face-cluster-core    | 4        | `NUMBER` of faces forming a cluster core (1-100)                                       |
| PHOTOPRISM_FACE_CLUSTER_DIST   | --face-cluster-dist    | 0.64     | Similarity `DISTANCE` of faces forming a cluster core (0.1-1.5)                        |
| PHOTOPRISM_FACE_MATCH_DIST     | --face-match-dist      | 0.46     | Similarity `OFFSET` for matching faces with existing clusters (0.1-1.5)                |


### Tuning Tips

- A reasonable range for the similarity distance between face embeddings is between 0.60 and 0.70, with a higher value being more aggressive and leading to larger clusters with more false positives.
- To cluster a smaller number of faces, you can reduce the kernel to 3 or 2 similar faces.
- The ONNX engine typically provides better results on challenging photos (angles, occlusions, lighting) compared to Pigo.
- Use `FACE_ENGINE=auto` to automatically select the best available engine.

## Face Embeddings

After detection, PhotoPrism generates 512-dimensional embedding vectors using TensorFlow to characterize each face. These embeddings are used to:

1. **Match faces** across different photos
2. **Cluster similar faces** using the DBSCAN algorithm
3. **Assign faces to people** with manual confirmation

### Normalization

All face embeddings are L2-normalized to unit length (‖x‖₂ = 1) at:

- Creation time (after TensorFlow inference)
- Midpoint calculation when merging clusters
- Deserialization when loading from the database

This normalization ensures that Euclidean distance comparisons are equivalent to cosine similarity, aligning with FaceNet research standards.

## CLI Reference

- `photoprism faces stats` — show counts and engine info.
- `photoprism faces audit [--subject UID] [--fix]` — check and optionally repair face data.
- `photoprism faces reset [--engine auto|pigo|onnx] [--force]` — wipe people and markers, then regenerate with the chosen engine.
- `photoprism faces index` — (re)detect faces in originals.
- `photoprism faces update [--force]` — cluster and match detected faces.
- `photoprism faces optimize` — compact clusters after updates.

### Version Upgrade

To benefit from the [facial recognition improvements](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/5167), we recommend running `photoprism faces audit --fix` and `photoprism faces index` [in a terminal](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/docker-compose/#opening-a-terminal) to resolve any inconsistencies before detecting and matching additional faces:

```bash
photoprism faces audit --fix # resolve inconsistencies
photoprism faces index       # detect new faces
photoprism faces update      # cluster and match
photoprism faces optimize    # optional tidy-up
```

!!! note ""
    A [complete rescan](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/library/originals/#when-should-complete-rescan-be-selected) will also detect additional faces, but takes longer since more indexing tasks are performed.
