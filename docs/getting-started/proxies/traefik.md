# Using Traefik as Reverse Proxy

!!! success "Best Choice"
    - No custom middleware required for WebSockets or HTTP/2
    - [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) issues and renews [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates automatically
    - Integrates cleanly with Docker labels, Kubernetes ingress, and static config files

To run PhotoPrism behind Traefik, create a `traefik.yaml` configuration and then add a `traefik` service to your `compose.yaml` or `docker-compose.yml` file, as shown in the following example:

!!! example "compose.yaml"
    ```yaml
    services:
      traefik:
        image: traefik:v3.6
        restart: unless-stopped
        ports:
          - "80:80"
          - "443:443"
        volumes:
          - "./traefik.yaml:/etc/traefik/traefik.yaml"
          - "./traefik/data:/data"
          - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"

      photoprism:
        image: photoprism/photoprism:latest
        restart: unless-stopped
        labels:
          - "traefik.enable=true"
          - "traefik.http.routers.photoprism.rule=Host(`photos.example.com`)"
          - "traefik.http.routers.photoprism.entrypoints=websecure"
          - "traefik.http.routers.photoprism.tls=true"
          - "traefik.http.routers.photoprism.tls.certresolver=myresolver"
          - "traefik.http.services.photoprism.loadbalancer.server.port=2342"
        volumes:
          - "./originals:/photoprism/originals"
          - "./storage:/photoprism/storage"
        environment:
          PHOTOPRISM_SITE_URL: "https://photos.example.com/"
          PHOTOPRISM_DISABLE_TLS: "true"
    ```

!!! example "traefik.yaml"
    ```yaml
    log:
      level: INFO

    global:
      sendAnonymousUsage: false

    entryPoints:
      web:
        address: ":80"
        http:
          redirections:
            entryPoint:
              to: websecure
              scheme: https
      websecure:
        address: ":443"
        transport:
          respondingTimeouts:
            readTimeout: "3h"
            writeTimeout: "0s"

    providers:
      docker:
        exposedByDefault: false
        watch: true
    
    api:
      insecure: false
      dashboard: false
      debug: false
    
    certificatesResolvers:
      myresolver:
        acme:
          email: ssl-admin@example.com
          storage: /data/certs.json
          httpChallenge:
            entryPoint: web
    ```

Note that you must disable [HTTPS/TLS](../using-https.md#1-https-reverse-proxy) in PhotoPrism by setting `PHOTOPRISM_DISABLE_TLS` to `"true"`, because Traefik is already handling TLS termination. The service label `traefik.http.services.photoprism.loadbalancer.server.port=2342` tells Traefik which internal port to use.

Further `traefik.yaml` examples and a detailed description of the Traefik configuration can be found in the [corresponding documentation](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/user-guides/docker-compose/basic-example/).

### Why Use a Proxy? ###

If you install PhotoPrism on a public server outside your home network, **always run it behind a secure
HTTPS reverse proxy**. Your files and passwords will otherwise be transmitted in clear text and can be intercepted
by anyone, including your provider, hackers, and governments. Backup tools and file sync apps may refuse to
connect as well.
