!!! danger "Getting Support"
    Since [NGINX](../proxies/nginx.md) can be [tricky to configure](https://www.nginx.com/nginx-wiki/build/dirhtml/start/topics/tutorials/config_pitfalls/) we cannot [provide individual support](https://www.photoprism.app/kb/getting-support) for proxy-related errors such as [failed uploads](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/discussions/2698#discussioncomment-9056567), [connection issues](../troubleshooting/index.md#connection-fails), [broken thumbnails](../troubleshooting/index.md#broken-thumbnails), or [video playback problems](../troubleshooting/index.md#videos-dont-play). Please reach out to the NGINX community or switch to [Traefik](../proxies/traefik.md) if you prefer an easier reverse proxy.

Running PhotoPrism behind a hardened reverse proxy adds TLS, HTTP/2, request filtering, and long-request buffering that our embedded Go HTTP server intentionally keeps minimal. If you expose PhotoPrism to the public internet, you **must** terminate HTTPS properly and keep the host patched.

The examples below use `photoprism.example.com`; replace it with your own domain or DynDNS record. Commands target Ubuntu 20.04+, but the concepts apply to other distributions.

## Prerequisites

- A domain or DynDNS record that resolves to the proxy host.
- PhotoPrism running on the local network (container, VM, or bare metal).
- Shell access with `sudo` privileges.
- Open TCP ports 80 and 443 on the proxy plus a firewall rule that only exposes those services externally.

!!! tip
    Most consumer routers include a DynDNS client. Consult your router manual or search for `your-router-model dyndns` to keep DNS records updated automatically.

## Step 1: Install NGINX and Helper Packages

Install the proxy (can be the same host that runs Docker) and a utility package for optional HTTP basic authentication:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y nginx apache2-utils
```

Enable and start the service if systemd did not do it automatically:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now nginx
```

## Step 2: Obtain TLS Certificates with Let's Encrypt

Install Certbot plus the NGINX plugin:

```bash
sudo apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

Request a certificate (the host must be reachable on TCP 80/443 during issuance):

```bash
sudo certbot certonly --nginx -d photoprism.example.com
```

Certificates appear under `/etc/letsencrypt/live/photoprism.example.com/`. Certbot installs a systemd timer for automatic renewal; verify it with `sudo certbot renew --dry-run` and monitor `/var/log/letsencrypt/` for errors.

## Step 3: Create the NGINX Site Configuration

Create `/etc/nginx/sites-available/photoprism.example.com` with content similar to the snippet below. Adjust the upstream address (`docker.homenet:2342` in this example) to point at your PhotoPrism container or VM.

```nginx
upstream photoprism_app {
    server docker.homenet:2342;   # PhotoPrism service or load balancer
}

server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name photoprism.example.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name photoprism.example.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/photoprism.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/photoprism.example.com/privkey.pem;
    ssl_protocols       TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers         HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5:!3DES;
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
    ssl_stapling on;
    ssl_stapling_verify on;

    resolver 1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8 9.9.9.9 valid=300s;
    resolver_timeout 5s;

    client_max_body_size 512M;        # Allow large uploads
    proxy_buffering off;              # Stream uploads directly
    proxy_read_timeout 600s;
    proxy_send_timeout 600s;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://photoprism_app;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;

        # Optional: uncomment to require basic auth (breaks WebDAV without extra config)
        # auth_basic           "Additional Authentication";
        # auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.photoprism_htpasswd;
    }
}
```

!!! warning
    Always adjust `photoprism_app` to the correct backend address (Docker service, Kubernetes service, or another host). Leaving it at the example value will expose the proxy without a working backend.

`connection_upgrade` is provided by NGINX’s `map` directive in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` on current Ubuntu releases. If your distribution does not define it, add `map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade { default upgrade; '' close; }` to the main configuration.

## Step 4: Enable the Site and Reload NGINX

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/photoprism.example.com \
           /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Visit `https://photoprism.example.com/` to confirm the certificate, login page, and uploads work. Use `curl -I https://photoprism.example.com/` to verify the redirect and response headers.

## Step 5: Optional Hardening

- **Firewall**: Allow inbound TCP 80/443 only. Restrict PhotoPrism’s internal port (2342 by default) to the proxy host.
- **Basic Authentication**: `sudo htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/.photoprism_htpasswd user1` adds a second login layer. Keep in mind that WebDAV and API clients must support it.
- **Rate Limiting**: NGINX’s `limit_req` module can slow brute-force attempts. Combine it with PhotoPrism’s own throttling options (`PHOTOPRISM_PASSWORD_LENGTH`, `PHOTOPRISM_LOGIN_LIMIT`).
- **Monitoring**: Tail `/var/log/nginx/access.log` and `/var/log/nginx/error.log` after configuration changes. Failed uploads typically show up as `413 Request Entity Too Large`, which signals that `client_max_body_size` needs to be increased.

!!! warning
    Keep your operating system, NGINX packages, and Certbot up to date. Unpatched proxies are a common attack vector even when PhotoPrism itself is isolated behind the service.
