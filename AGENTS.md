# PhotoPrism® Docs Repository Guidelines

**Last Updated:** November 15, 2025

## Purpose

This file serves as a single, up-to-date reference for agents and contributors working on PhotoPrism's public documentation. It explains where canonical content is located, how to preview and ship changes, and which conventions maintain consistency between https://docs.photoprism.app/ and the main application repository at https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/.

## Sources of Truth

- `README.md` — contributor onboarding, MkDocs overview, and deployment expectations for this repository.
- `mkdocs.yml` — primary navigation tree (Getting Started, User Guide, Developer Guide, About) and metadata used by MkDocs Material. The `nav:` map is the sole source of truth for site navigation, so every new page must be registered there before it becomes visible in the UI.
- `mkdocs.deploy.yml` — release-time configuration that enables the privacy plugin, mirrors remote assets, and hosts redirect rules.
- Main app references: `/home/michael/src/photoprism/photoprism/AGENTS.md` and `/home/michael/src/photoprism/photoprism/CODEMAP.md` remain authoritative for product behavior, CLI semantics, and backend/frontend boundaries.
- Published docs: https://docs.photoprism.app/ is the live contract; verify edits there before referencing version-specific behavior.
- Contributor process notes: `docs/developer-guide/documentation.md`, `docs/developer-guide/pull-requests.md`, and `docs/developer-guide/reviewing-pull-requests.md` describe how documentation changes are reviewed alongside code.
- Make targets defined in `Makefile` (e.g., `make deps`, `make watch`, `make merge`) are the supported way to install dependencies, run MkDocs, resize images, and deploy.

## Documentation Scope

- MkDocs pulls Markdown from `docs/`, where the top folders align with the site navigation: `getting-started/`, `user-guide/`, and `developer-guide/`. Keep new topics inside these trees to benefit from inherited index pages and local `img/` directories.
- Directory names mirror canonical URLs, not necessarily the navigation hierarchy. For example, `docs/release-notes.md` renders at https://docs.photoprism.app/release-notes/ for a short path, even though its nav entry lives under “User Guide > Release Notes”. Maintain these short-link exceptions when they exist.
- Landing and shared pages live at `docs/index.md`, `docs/known-issues.md`, `docs/release-notes.md`, `docs/credits.md`, and `docs/license/` (AGPL, Apache, and documentation terms). Update these when legal notices or release metadata change.
- Static assets ship from `docs/img/` (global) and the section-specific `img/` folders. Icons and favicons reside in `docs/icons/`; logos include `docs/icons/logo/*.svg` plus `docs/icons/LICENSE`.
- Styling overrides belong in `docs/css/custom.css`. Theme overrides live in `overrides/` (`main.html` for OG/Twitter tags and analytics, `partials/copyright.html` for footer text).
- Work-in-progress drafts go under `todo/` (currently `todo/developer-guide/setup-fedora.md`). Clearly mark TODO files until they are promoted into `docs/`.

## Build & Preview Workflow

- Local Python environment: run `make deps` on Debian/Ubuntu (installs system packages) or `make install` elsewhere. Both targets create `venv/`, grab MkDocs Material (the former Insiders build now ships via PyPI, so no `GH_TOKEN` is required), and pull all pinned requirements from `requirements.txt`.
- Refresh dependencies with `make upgrade` whenever you need the latest MkDocs Material release; it rebuilds the virtualenv before you start working.
- Preview: `make watch` (alias for `make serve`) invokes `./venv/bin/mkdocs serve --livereload --watch docs --watch overrides --watch mkdocs.yml -a 0.0.0.0:8000`. A common loop is `make upgrade && make watch`, then browse http://localhost:8000/ while MkDocs hot-reloads Markdown, templates, and configuration.
- Build artifacts: `make build` renders the production site using `mkdocs.deploy.yml`, while `make deploy` runs `mkdocs gh-deploy --force --config-file mkdocs.deploy.yml` for manual GitHub Pages pushes. The rendered HTML lands in `site/` locally—never edit files there by hand or commit that directory.
- Image hygiene: `make img-resize` (ImageMagick `mogrify`) enforces a `1000x860` max width for specific folders. Run it after adding screenshots to `docs/user-guide/img` or `docs/getting-started/**/img`.
- Containerized workflow: a `Dockerfile` exists (`squidfunk/mkdocs-material:latest`), but it is not part of the supported toolchain because previous revisions broke; stay on the Python virtualenv workflow unless the team explicitly revives the container path.

## Repository Layout & Ownership

- `mkdocs.yml` defines navigation, metadata (`site_name`, `extra.social`, edit links), plugins (`redirects`), theme options, and Markdown extensions (pymdownx, tooltips, tabs, mermaid). Always update nav entries and redirect maps in this file when adding or moving pages.
- `mkdocs.deploy.yml` inherits from `mkdocs.yml` but appends `search`, `privacy`, and a release-specific redirect map. When you add redirects, mirror them in both configs so local previews and production builds behave the same.
- `overrides/` contains the only custom templates. `overrides/main.html` augments meta tags, favicons, analytics, and announcement banners; update it when branding or tracking domains change. `overrides/partials/copyright.html` injects footer copy.
- `docs/css/custom.css` holds layout tweaks for the Material theme; limit overrides to what cannot be configured in `mkdocs.yml` and keep selectors scoped to avoid regressions.
- `LICENSE` (root) covers the repository; `docs/license/docs.md` spells out the documentation license (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0). Keep legal text in sync with the main application repository when terms change.
- Helper directories: `venv/` (local virtualenv), `site/` (build output), and `todo/` (drafts) are workspace artifacts; they should remain uncommitted and are safe to delete when resetting your environment.

## Content Standards

- Headings, link titles, and navigation labels must use Title Case, matching the main repository’s style requirement. When copying headings from other sources, normalize them before committing.
- Prefer Markdown over raw HTML; use MkDocs Material components (admonitions, tabs, tooltips) configured in `mkdocs.yml`. When HTML is unavoidable, keep it minimal and validate that `mkdocs serve` renders it correctly in dark/light themes.
- Update `mkdocs.yml` navigation whenever you add, rename, or move a page. If a URL changes, add a redirect entry to both `mkdocs.yml` and `mkdocs.deploy.yml` so legacy links stay valid.
- Store images next to the Markdown that references them (for example, `docs/user-guide/organize/img/`). Optimize screenshots before committing and include descriptive alt text in Markdown.
- Reuse canonical CLI flags, file paths, and configuration snippets from the main PhotoPrism repository. When documenting new application behavior, confirm the implementation in `photoprism/photoprism` before publishing.
- Front matter: use MkDocs `meta` blocks (or the `page.meta` keys referenced in `overrides/main.html`) when you need a custom page title or social caption. Avoid adding bespoke metadata keys unless templates consume them.

## Deployment & Publishing

- Working branch is `develop`. Merge `develop` into `deploy` (or run `make merge`) to trigger the GitHub Actions pipeline that rebuilds and uploads docs to docs.photoprism.app. Always resolve conflicts locally so deployment commits stay clean.
- `mkdocs deploy` is reserved for emergency GitHub Pages pushes; it writes to the `gh-pages` branch. Coordinate with maintainers before using it so automation does not overwrite manual changes.
- The privacy plugin (`mkdocs-material-privacy` via `mkdocs.deploy.yml`) mirrors external assets (badges, images) into the site. Keep `assets_exclude` up to date when new Photoprism-owned domains are introduced.
- Verify redirects, social previews, and structured data locally with `mkdocs build` before merging. Production uses the same config, so a clean local build is the release gate.

## Security & Access

- Never commit credentials. MkDocs Material Insiders is now public on PyPI, so we no longer ask contributors to add `GH_TOKEN` values to `.env`; keep that file untracked if you use it for other local overrides.
- Treat `docs/license`, `docs/icons/LICENSE`, and `docs/img/LICENSE` as authoritative for third-party assets. Confirm redistribution rights before adding new binaries or artwork.
- All social sharing and analytics scripts live in `overrides/main.html`. Review those tags when changing analytics providers to ensure we only load scripts from approved domains (`a.photoprism.app` for outbound tracking).
- Follow the main repository’s security and contribution policies (see `SECURITY.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` in photoprism/photoprism) when referencing vulnerabilities or non-public features in these docs.
